bandit level 7
file to be found has the properties:-

owned by user bandit7
owned by group bandit6
33 bytes in size

on checking syntax of find again we use -user for user -group for group and the "/" command to search the root system

code typed
ls
ls -a
find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c

on typing this command we get a lot of permission denied on the terminal
going through this we find one /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password which does not have permission denied and when we cat the contents we get the password

cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password

password obtained:- z7WtoNQU2XfjmMtWA8u5rN4vzqu4v99S
