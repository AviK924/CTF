bandit level 12
problem says all characters are rotated by 13, looking into the tr command and googling the syntax we see that the tr command is used to replace and manipulate characters in a text file. on googling how to use the command to decode rot13 we come up with 
tr ['A-Za-z'] ['N-ZA-Mn-za-m'] 
which makes the characters in a string rotate by 13
and on pairing it with the cat command we get the required password

code typed:-
ls
cat data.txt
cat data.txt | tr ['A-Za-z'] ['N-ZA-Mn-za-m']

password obtained - JVNBBFSmZwKKOP0XbFXOoW8chDz5yVRv
