bandit level 5
Password is stored in a human readable file in inhere directory
we use the file command to check what kind of file the file is
here we look for ASCII type of file

code typed
ls
cd inhere
ls
file ./-file00
file ./-file01
file ./-file02
file ./-file03
file ./-file04
file ./-file05
file ./-file06
file ./-file07
file ./-file08
file ./-file09

when we cat any of the files it shows non readable text, on using the file command on all files we find that -file07 is of ASCII type. when we cat its contents we get the required password

password obtained - lrIWWI6bB37kxfiCQZqUdOIYfr6eEeqR
