bandit level 6
file has the properties
human-readable
1033 bytes in size
not executable

to find a file we use the "find" command
after looking for the syntax i found that f is used for regular files and c is used to indicate bytes 

code typed
ls
cd inhere
ls
find -type f -size 1033c

this gives the location of one file
cat maybehere07/.file2
