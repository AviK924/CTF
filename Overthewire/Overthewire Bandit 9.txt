the password is in data.txt in the line that occours only once

looking for the sort syntax and the uniq syntax i tried

code typed:-

cat data.txt
sort data.txt

this gives the text sorted, therefore after pairing it with the uniq command i get the password

sort data.txt | uniq -u

password obtained - EN632PlfYiZbn3PhVK3XOGSlNInNE00t
