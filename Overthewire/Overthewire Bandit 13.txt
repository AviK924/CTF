bandit level 13
reading the manuals given for the commands tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd , mkdir, cp and mv

the question asks us to craete a new working directory under /tmp and copy the file there and perform operations
for this we use 
mkdir /tmp/ABC123
and then use the cp command to copy the file into the directory
cp data.txt /tmp/ABC123
and then navigate into the temp folder
initially it says the file is a hexdump which has been repeteadly compressed,
we see that the xxd command is used for creating or reversing a hex dump and xxd -r is used to revert a hex dump,
initially on using xxd -r data.txt it simply displays the reversed hex dump and doesnt store it, on googling i found
the “>” is an output operator that overwrites the existing file
using this along with the xxr command i can overwrite a new file, therefore creating a new file using touch and then the xxr command
touch ban.txt
xxr -d data.txt > ban.txt
and now ban.txt has the reversed hex dump but the file still isnt human readable
on performing file ban.txt we see that the it is compressed in gzip format
checking the commands of gzip, -d is used to decompress but the file has to have the gzip extension for this, and the manual says the extension is .gz
to change the extension we use the mv command
mv ban.txt ban.gz
and then we can use any of the following commands to decompress
gzip -d ban.gz
gunzip ban.gz 
as the manual says gunzip can decompress files with .gz extension
then checking the file again it says it is bzip2 compressed
on checking manual for bzip2 we find the extension as .bz2 and the decompression command as either bunzip2 or -d with bzip2
using the command
mv ban ban.bz2
bzip2 -d ban.bz2
or
bunzip2 ban.bz2
after this when we check the file again it is gzip compressed, performing same procdeure
mv ban ban.gz
gunzip ban.gz
after this when we check the file it is in POSIX tar archive
checking manual for tar the extension is .tar and -x is used to extract and f is used for regular file therefore using
mv ban ban.tar
tar -xf ban.tar
we see a bin file is formed which is again of type tar
renaming
mv data5.bin data5.tar
tar -xf data5.tar
another bin file is formed it is of bzip2 type
using same procedure as above
mv data6.bin data6.bz2
bzip2 -d data6.bz2
on checking file again it is of POSIX tar
doing same thing for tar
mv data6 data6.tar
tar -xf data6.tar
another bin file is formed
it is of type gzip
doing same procedure for gzip
mv data8.bin data8.gz
gzip -d data8.gz
after this the file type shows ASCII text and when we cat its contents we get the required password
